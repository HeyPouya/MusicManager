## Description

### How app works

This application is designed to find singers and their top albums. I used the api from last.fm website (you can find the details in api secion). There are 4 main pages :

1. Saved albums : shows albums saved by user. works also in offline mode
2. Search artist
3. Top albums : shows top albums of the selected artist.
4. Album details : shows details of the selected album


##### or you can omit adding some properties in Kotlin

```java
    list.add(UpdaterStoreList(Store.GOOGLE_PLAY, "Download From Google Play", packageName = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID))
```
